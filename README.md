###As a player I want:

-> multiple options to choose my abilities, weapon, equipment (to have control over my gameplay)
-> good music (to feel good playing)
-> detailed graphics (to notice from time to time something new)
-> smooth gameplay (that can run properly on my device)
-> game lore (to know my purpose in this game)
-> a map or level (to be able to see my progress)
-> bug free and interesting features (to find out the feature's utility on my own)
-> health bar (so I can see when I have to be careful)
-> penalties accorting to the importance of the mission (to know the importance of a specific mission)
-> a good ending (to feel that I've played a magical game)
